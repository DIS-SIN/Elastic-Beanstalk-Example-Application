### BACKLOG ###

# add Bob ratings
# check all DB indices
# add admin accounts
	# roll-out very slowly, try with 1 course from Jeremy and 1 from regions
	# check if upload is dangerous

# solve old Google Maps API issue
	# clear out use of google nlp api
	# delete use of API key on GCDocs, GH
# IDEA: rip out 2 fiscal years, do 12 month rolling window (or 16 months to include future for planned offerings), but do so in separate branch
# decouple frontend and backend
	# check out flask-restful
	# Maps tab could get a lot better if decoupled
		# maps API route could accept start_date, end_date, offering_lang, etc.
		# users could select options, map would delete markers and re-add
		# do same thing for Dashboards tab
		# especially comments tab, filter by star, classfication, dept, and download it all
# upcoming offerings; maybe link to GCcampus
# add offering dates to maps
# copyright
# explore by director
	# show flags e.g. regs gone down, copyright expired, no prep and admin, bad sentiment scores, open offerings from last year
	# email director the problems for delegation
# add dept usage
# unit testing
