	# other queries that could be strategically disabled???

# add datatables to depts and classifications
# pagination -> reënable A230
# update FR
# ETL
# check mobile e.g. prevent dropdown glyph from being part of what's centered
	# check spacing e.g. hidden Offerings needs min height
# rename CSS
# name change + launch V1!
	# email to everyone who was at DGC
	# ask if you like 12 month rolling or two fiscal
	# send GA test traffic



# solve old Google Maps API issue
# clear out use of google nlp api
# delete use of API key on GCDocs, GH



### BACKLOG ###

# check all indices
# IDEA: # rip out 2 fiscal years, do 12 month rolling window (or 16 months to include future for planned offerings), but do so in separate branch
	# comment things out, make it all run off THIS_YEAR in case there's a revolt
# update scraper to grab code from title rather than URL
# load rate (Christine Dionne)
# a few averages of ratings (Bob)
# add admin accounts
	# roll-out very slowly, try with 1 course from Jeremy and 1 from regions
	# check if upload is dangerous
# decouple frontend and backend
	# check out flask-restful
	# Maps tab could get a lot better if decoupled
		# maps API route could accept start_date, end_date, offering_lang, etc.
		# users could select options, map would delete markers and re-add
		# do same thing for Dashboards tab
# calendar / table with upcoming offerings + link to GCcampus
# add offering dates to maps
# copyright
# explore by director
	# show flags e.g. regs gone down, copyright expired, no prep and admin, bad sentiment scores, open offerings from last year
	# email director the problems for delegation
# add dept usage
# focus groups w/ users, brainstorm for new KPIs
# unit testing
