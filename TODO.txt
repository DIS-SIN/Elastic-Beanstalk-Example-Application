# load rate, a few averages of ratings (Christine Dionne)
# add admin accounts
	# roll-out very slowly, try with 1 course from Jeremy and 1 from regions
	# check if upload is dangerous
# decouple frontend and backend
	# check out flask-restful
	# Maps tab could get a lot better if decoupled
		# maps API route could accept start_date, end_date, offering_lang, etc.
		# users could select options, map would delete markers and re-add
# calendar / table with upcoming offerings + link to GCcampus
# ratings tab to show sentiment analysis over time
# add clustering (e.g. latent dirichlet) to check top 5 issues mentioned
	# only enable button if > 50 comments
	# sort by most recent first
# add offering dates to maps
