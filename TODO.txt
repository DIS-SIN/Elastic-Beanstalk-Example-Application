# decouple, only use Registhor API

# possibly add back certain ratings
# add admin accounts
	# roll-out slowly, try with 1 course from Jeremy and 1 from regions
	# check if upload is dangerous
# get Highcharts licence



### DEPARTMENTS ###
- login: dropdown, select dept name
	- input machine generated access token
		- simple script to send to all depts, then they can pass it around amongst themselves, as staff changes
- pipeline: linda hears about dept name change, merge, etc. -> DIS inbox for updating
- depts could enter info we want e.g. what courses do you consider mandatory
